The project of this app is one of my first publications on the Apple AppStore in 2015. When I closed my account in 2017 the code was forgotten and the project was left in the bottom shelf of my drawer. With corona knocking on our door I finally found the time to read through my old code and refactor it a bit. It's far from perfect and lacks a clean architectural concept though it was always dear to me. Therefore I felt obliged to get an AppStore account again and publish it for free. At the same time I would like others to learn from my mistakes. Therefore the whole codebase is open source.

Depending on my availability I will maybe publish some additional updates here and on the AppStore.
